<div class="rectangle" > <p>   Jack allows you to send text, photo and/or video messages and decide when these can be read. While a message is delivered instantly, the recipient must wait before the message can be read: when sending a message, the sender specifies when it can be read by the receiver - it can be any hours, days, weeks, months or even more. Jackâ€™s unique approach is to combine instant notification (i.e. the recipient is notified immediately that he has received a Jack) and delayed delivery (i.e. the recipient may not open the Jack until the right moment has been reached). The waiting period between the moment the Jack is delivered and the moment it can be read creates anticipation.</p></div>
